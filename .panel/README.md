#How to use?

Put those files in your $PATH.

##Panel
`panel` starts the panel and the fifo stream.

`panel-skeleton` interprets where to put each information that is piped to the fifo.

`panel-settings` contains various settings, like the colors. It's loaded by the other scripts.

All the special character (icons...) are custom made. You need the MonteCarloPanel and MonteCarloMedium fonts from my Mon√©gasque repo.

##Notifications
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/master/.panel/Previews/notstat.gif)
The music notifiction on the left of the panel is generated by *not-stat*, a shell script inspired by [statnot](https://github.com/halhen/statnot).

`pkill not-stat ; not-stat -m &` is called by [mpdcron](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1354247) on each song change.

It's also bound to keybinds, for example with those lines in your sxhkdrc:

    XF86AudioRaiseVolume
     amixer set PCM 1dB+ ; pkill not-stat ; not-stat -v

Pressing the XF86AudioRaiseVolume will raise the PCM channel volume by 1 decibel, display the new volume value and show the music status again after three seconds of inactivity.
Read my sxhkdrc if you want other examples.

`pkill not-stat ; not-stat -<x>` is also called when clicking on various buttons or when using the different sliders.

##Monitor menu
The pink buttons menu is generated by `panel-monitor`, and the stand-alone music monitor is made by `panel-music_control`.

##Dzen popup (volume and brightness sliders)
Don't forget to create `~/.panel/PID/dzen-submenu.pid`, else a few things won't work (like closing it properly, or updating the slider position by other means than clicking on the slider).

###Sound
Should work out of the box, supposing you are using ALSA.

###Brightness
To draw the slider, it reads the current screen brightness value in `/sys/<...>/backlight/<...>/brightness` and its max value in `/sys/<...>/backlight/<...>/max_brightness`. The path to those files probably won't be the same on your system, so edit this.

The same for the script I use to change the backlight, you will need to adapt it to your system.


###Music
It provides shortcuts to launch [mpdviz](https://github.com/neeee/mpdviz), ncmpcpp and my [coverart](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/coverart) script.

##Start Menu
The start menu was made with `mygtkmenu`. The line calling it is in `panel-skeleton`, edit it to work on your system.

##Mails
`panel-mail` is called by cron after it fetches mails:

    0 * * * * /usr/bin/getmail --rcfile mailbox1 --rcfile mailbox2 ; /home/tatou/.bin/panel-mail

You should also make an alias so it's called when you close mutt:

    alias mutt='mutt ; mailbox_to_fifo'

In the panel, you can click on the icon to hide the number of unread mails.

##Calendar
Found it on Twily's [website](twily.info), tweaked it a bit.

If you click on the date in the panel, it will open. If you click again on the date, it will close.

Don't forget to create `~/.panel/PID/calendar.pid`, else the above behavior won't work.
