# This program just modifies the value of backlight keyboard for Apple Laptops
# You must run it as root user or via sudo.
# As a shortcut you could allow to admin users to run via sudo without password
# prompt. To do this you must add sudoers file the next contents:
#
#   ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/keyboard-backlight
#
# You must then install the script in the path given above, eg, /usr/sbin/
# If you chose another path, then the location in the sudoers file must reflect 
# that path.
#
# After this you can use this script as follows:
#
#     Increase backlight keyboard:
#           $ sudo keyboard-backlight up
#     Decrease backlight keyboard:
#           $ sudo keyboard-backlight down
#
# You can customize the amount of backlight by step by changing the INCREMENT
# variable as you want it.

BACKLIGHT=$(cat /sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness)
INCREMENT=10
